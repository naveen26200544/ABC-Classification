# 🏭 Smart Inventory Optimization using Machine Learning

An intelligent inventory management system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to optimize stock control through ABC Classification methodology. This project addresses the critical challenges of modern supply chain management, particularly in volatile market conditions like those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system implements a comprehensive ML-driven approach to inventory classification and optimization, helping businesses make data-driven decisions about stock levels, reorder points, and resource allocation. By applying the Pareto 80/20 principle through ABC Classification, the system categorizes inventory items based on their relative importance and value contribution.

## 🔬 Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented

The project compares and evaluates five powerful ML algorithms for inventory classification:

- *Random Forest Classifier* - Best Performance: 93% accuracy
- *Decision Tree Algorithm* - 87% accuracy
- *Naïve Bayes Classifier* - 74% accuracy
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* - 54% accuracy
- *Support Vector Machines (SVM)* - 40% accuracy

## 🏗 System Architecture

### Core Components:
1. *Data Preprocessing & Feature Selection* - Intelligent data preparation and feature engineering
2. *ML Algorithm Implementation* - Multiple classifier models for ABC categorization
3. *Database Management System* - Robust data storage and retrieval system
4. *Flask Web Interface* - User-friendly front-end for system interaction

### ABC Classification Framework:
- *Class A*: High-value, high-priority items (require aggressive management)
- *Class B*: Medium-value items (moderate management approach)
- *Class C*: Low-value items (efficient, cost-effective management)

## 📊 Key Features

- *Multi-Criteria Classification*: Considers factors like cost, demand patterns, seasonality, and supply chain dynamics
- *Real-time SKU Classification*: Dynamic categorization of stock-keeping units
- *Predictive Analytics*: Demand forecasting and inventory optimization
- *Performance Metrics*: Comprehensive evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy
- *Comparative Analysis*: Side-by-side comparison of multiple ML algorithms

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- *Backend*: Python
- *Machine Learning*: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- *Database*: SQL-based DBMS
- *Data Processing*: Feature engineering and preprocessing pipelines

## 📈 Dataset Features

The system analyzes inventory items based on 14 key parameters:
- Item Cost & Count
- Total Cost & Lead Time
- Shelf Life & EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)
- Lead Time Variability
- Seasonality Patterns
- Warehouse Location
- Customer Reviews
- Historical Sales Data
- Demand Fluctuation
- ABC Classification Labels

## 🎯 Business Impact

- *Cost Reduction*: Optimized inventory levels reduce carrying costs
- *Stockout Prevention*: Intelligent reorder point calculations
- *Resource Optimization*: Efficient allocation based on item importance
- *Supply Chain Resilience*: Better handling of demand volatility
- *Data-Driven Decisions*: ML-powered insights for strategic planning
